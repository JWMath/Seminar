# I. Seminars on 2020.4.13

## I.1 Title : Topological Quantum Computing and Untary Representations of the Artin Braid Group
### Speaker : Louis Kauffman
### Time: 13 April 2020, 18:30 (UTC+3)
### Organization: Knots and representation theory by skype (@knots-in-moscow)
### Information from [Seminars on knot theory and related topics](https://www.ktrt-seminars.com/)
### Abstract : This talk will review the basics of quantum theory and quantum computation. Then we discuss how unitary braid group representations associated with the Temperley Lieb Recoupling theory for the Jones polynomial can in theory give universal quantum computation.

# II. Seminars on 2020.4.14
## II.1 Title: Invariants of 4-manifolds from Khovanov-Rozansky link homology
 ###  Speaker: Paul Wedrich (MPI Bonn)
 ###  Time:Tuesday, April 14, 2022, 4:00 PM（UTC-8）
 ###  Zoom: [link](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/424763284)
 ###  Abstract: Ribbon categories are 3-dimensional algebraic structures that control quantum link polynomials and that give rise to 3-manifold invariants known as skein modules. I will describe how to use Khovanov-Rozansky link homology, a categorification of the gl(N) quantum link polynomial, to obtain a 4-dimensional algebraic structure that gives rise to vector space-valued invariants of smooth 4-manifolds. The technical heart of this construction is the newly established functoriality of Khovanov-Rozansky homology in the 3-sphere. Based on joint work with Scott Morrison and Kevin Walker.

# III. Seminars on 2020.4.15
## III.1 Title : SL(3,C)-representations of two-generator groups
### Speaker : Chen Haimiao
### Time: 15 April 2020, 10:30 - (UTC+3)
### Organization : Skype seminar of Moscow and Beijing by skype
### Information from [Seminars on knot theory and related topics](https://www.ktrt-seminars.com/)
### Abstract : SL(3,C)-representations of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds are interesting in low-dimensional topology, due to their close connections to geometric and topological structures. But till now few computations are seen in the literature. After a brief survey on background, I will present an efficient method for computing SL(3,C)-representations of any two-generator group. In particular, the SL(3,C)-character variety of each rational link can be written down.

### Organization : Mathematical colloquium in BMSTU by Zoom
### Information from [Seminars on knot theory and related topics](https://www.ktrt-seminars.com/)
### Abstract : Геометрия Аракелова - это способ "компактифицировать" арифметические объекты при помощи эрмитовых метрик, чтобы работать с этими объектами как с проективными алгебраическими многообразиями над полем. Я расскажу про основные понятия геометрии Аракелова в размерности один и два, то есть для арифметических кривых и арифметических поверхностей.

  
## IV.2 Title:Spectra of Laplacians on Cayley and Schreier graphs
  ### Speaker: Tatiana Smirnova-Nagnibeda (University of Geneva)
  ### Time: Thursday, April 16, 5–6pm edt(utc-4)
  ### Zoom: [link](https://zoom.us/j/651394835)meeting id: 651 394 835 (email Ilya Kapovich from a university email address for the password)
  ### Organizing institution: New York Group Theory Seminarr
  ### Information from [Online group theory seminars](https://nato.li/grouptheory)
  ### Abstract: We are interested in Laplacians on graphs associated with finitely generated groups: Cayley graphs and, more generally, Schreier graphs corresponding to some natural group actions. The spectrum of such an operator is a compact subset of the closed interval [−1,1], but not much more can be said about it in general. We will discuss various techniques that allow to construct examples with different types of spectra -- connected,union of two intervals, totally disconnected -- and with various types of spectral measure. The problem of spectral rigidity will also be addressed.
